[UKM Simulator](https://www.kavee.info/UKMSim)  

This shiny app is one of my first shiny app for nephrology related content. It is still not optimized but should work fine. I posted it on my Facebook since Octerber 2018 (previously hosted on shinyapps.io). Basically, the simulation follows the algorithm used in [ureakinetics.org](http://www.ureakinetics.org/) developed by Dr. John Daugirdas. By adjusting parameters on the left, simulated BUN over time will be updated on the right. This may useful for learning effects of each parametes on urea kinetics.
