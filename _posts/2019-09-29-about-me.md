Hi!, my name is *Kavee*. I'm a nephrologist trained in Thailand. I also have some experience on mass-spectrometry based proteomics and phosphoproteomics. This is post is my first post to try out Jekyll (with a [Millennial](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Millennial) theme from [Paul Le](https://www.lenpaul.com/)). One of my long-term goals is to create free educational resources (mainly Nephrology, Medicine, and maybe Proteomics) using various tools such as Shiny Apps (that's the things I know for now...any other recommendation is appreciated). I hope that this website will be a part to fullfil that goal :)
